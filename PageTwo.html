            <p>In life, the number of <span>beginnings</span> is exactly equal to the number of <span>endings</span>: no
                one has yet to <span>begin</span> a life who will not <span>end</span> it.  <br> <br>
                In poetry, the number of <span>beginnings</span> so far exceeds the number of <span>endings</span> that
                we cannot even conceive of it. Not every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned, another catches fire
                and is carried away by the wind, which may be an <span>ending</span>, but it is the <span>ending</span>
                of a poem without an <span>end</span>.  <br> <br>
                Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that no poem is ever <span>ended</span>, that every
                poem is merely abandoned. This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations
                <span>begin</span> is in a cloud.

            <p>In the <span>beginning</span> was the Word. Western civilization rests upon those words. And yet there is
                a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the <span>beginning</span> was the Act. that nothing can
                precede action—no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act. 
                <br> <br>
                I believe the poem is an act of the mind. I think it is easier to talk about the <span>end</span> of a
                poem than it is to talk about its <span>beginning</span>. Because the poem <span>ends</span> on the
                page, but it <span>begins</span> off the page, it begins in the mind. The mind acts, the mind wills a
                poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a
                chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it's your house.
