            <p>Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use at a standing-up-only party when
                everyone is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by
                the Esimo for snow. This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so
                constructed—English among them—that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. That
                sentence begins with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your last words right
                before you step into the limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. Or,
                if you are blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the
                sentence end.</p>
            <p>
                When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of semicolons!” he is
                absolutely right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the
                next time you use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of
                poetry) you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human
                being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all
                apparent purposes is unrelated. 



            </p>
            <p>You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, what connects the first line to the last, the
                act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. Between the first and last lines there
                exists—a poem—and if it were not for the poem that intervenes, the first and last lines of a poem would
                not speak to each other. </p>
            <p>Would not speak to each other. Because the lines of a poem are speaking to each other, not you to them or
                they to you.</p>
