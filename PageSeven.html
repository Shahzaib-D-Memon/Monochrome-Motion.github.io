            <p style="margin-top: 9rem;">It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore them, I read them, even if only
                silently, with a deep sense of feeling: both the feeling of being replete, a feeling of satisfaction,

            <p style=" padding-bottom: 5rem;">I have never, in my life, read a poem that ended with the words The End.
                Why is that, I wonder. I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel that there
                has been no great sustention of energy, no marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line. And
                then I found a poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade, and at the bottom
                of the page, in India ink, beautifully apart from the rest of the text, were the words The End. And I
                realized children very often denote the end because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have
                written anything, and they are completely unaware of the number of stories and poems that have already
                been written; they know some, of course, but have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the
                only persons residing on the planet. And so they sign their poems and stories like kings. Which is a
                wonderful thing. </p>

                        Roland Barthes suggests there are three ways to finish any piece of writing: the ending will
                        have
                        the last word or the ending will be silent or the ending will execute a pirouette, do something
                        unexpectedly incongruent.

                        Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing thing: We begin in admiration and
                        we
                        end by organizing our disappointment. The moment of admiration is the experience of something
                        unfiltered, vital and fresh—it could also be horror—and the moment of organization is both the
                        onset
                        of disappointment and its dignification; the least we can do is dignify our knowingness, the
                        loss of
                        some vitality through familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize
                        it,
                        think about it.

                    <p style="margin: 2rem auto">
                        I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one try inevitable thing. And if you believe
                        that, then you are conceding that in the beginning was the act, not the word.

                        The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper: “The image cannot be
                        disposed of a primordial
                        freshness which ideas can never claim.”

                        Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly uses text in some of his drawings
                        and paintings, usually
                        poetry, usually Dante. Many men and women have written long essays and lectures on the ideas
                        they see expressed in
                        Twombly’s work.
